--Welcome to your final assessment test! This will test your knowledge of the previous section, 
--focused on creating databases and table operations. 
This test will actually consist of a more open-ended assignment below:

--Complete the following task:

--Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

--The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, 
homeroom_number, phone,email, and graduation year.

--The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,

--homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

--The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:

     --We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.
     --We must have ids as the primary key of the tables
     --Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.

--Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) 
who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 
--and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.

--Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) 
who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. 
--His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.

--Keep in mind that these insert tasks may effect your constraints!
