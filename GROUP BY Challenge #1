-- We have two staff members with Staff IDs 1 and 2. 
-- We want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments.
-- How many payments did each staff member handle?
-- And how much was the total amount processed by each staff member?

     --first attempt
     
SELECT staff_id, amount
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id, SUM(amount)

     --last attempt
     
SELECT staff_id, COUNT(amount), SUM(amount) -- "How many payments" = COUNT(amount), "How much was the total" = SUM(amount)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id
