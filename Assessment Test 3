--Welcome to your final assessment test! This will test your knowledge of the previous section, 
--focused on creating databases and table operations. 
This test will actually consist of a more open-ended assignment below:

--Complete the following task:

--Create a new database called "School" this database should have two tables: teachers and students.

--The students table should have columns for student_id, first_name,last_name, 
homeroom_number, phone, email, and graduation_year.

--The teachers table should have columns for teacher_id, first_name, last_name,

--homeroom_number, department, email, and phone.

--The constraints are mostly up to you, but your table constraints do have to consider the following:

     --We must have a phone number to contact students in case of an emergency.
     --We must have ids as the primary key of the tables
     --Phone numbers and emails must be unique to the individual.
        
-- Step 1 --
        
        CREATE DATABASE school;
 
-- Step 2 --

        CREATE TABLE students(
          student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
          last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
          homeroom_number INTEGER,
          phone VARCHAR(12) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
          email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
          graduation_year INTEGER
          );
        
-- Step 3 --

        CREATE TABLE teachers(
          teacher_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
          first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
          last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
          homeroom_number INTEGER,
          department VARCHAR(50),
    	     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
          phone VARCHAR(12) UNIQUE
          );
        

--Once you've made the tables, insert a student named Mark Watney (student_id=1) 
who has a phone number of 777-555-1234 
--and doesn't have an email. He graduates in 2035 and has 5 as a homeroom number.


-- step 4 -- 

     INSERT INTO students(student_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, emergency_phone, graduation_year)
     VALUES(1, 'Mark', 'Watney', 5, '777-555-1234', 2035);
     
--Then insert a teacher names Jonas Salk (teacher_id = 1) 
who as a homeroom number of 5 and is from the Biology department. 
--His contact info is: jsalk@school.org and a phone number of 777-555-4321.

-- Step 5 --

INSERT INTO teachers(teacher_id, first_name, last_name, homeroom_number, department, email, phone)
VALUES (1, 'Jonas', 'Salk', 5, 'Biology','jsalk@school.org', '777-555-4321');


--Keep in mind that these insert tasks may effect your constraints!
